// we would need to mock some inputs to test the systems functionality and ability to handle edge cases.

// Test the return button functionality to make sure it returns the payment total to 0 and ejects all of the users coins.

// Test rejection function to make sure it rejects invalid inputs.

// Test the dispense function to make sure it dispenses the correct amount of coins based on the payment total and the item price.
