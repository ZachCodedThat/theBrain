# The Vending Machine Brain!

This was a really excellent thought experiement to drive home TDD and how it helps us with what we build.

### The Break Down

- I wanted to provide a link to my [personal notion Doc](https://spiffy-elbow-50a.notion.site/Vending-Machine-Brain-31145718861f4baca7d205377a5dc549) I used to sketch out this project. This is where I talk about what future ideas could be brought to the project and how we can get **automation** involved to handle things like scale and inv managment.

- I used Typescript for the upfront awesomeness of type saftey and auto complete but where this pick pays off is down the line when this needs to scale into a production product. By adding things like TRPC to the mix we can ensure that even our API calls are as type safe as what we are passing around locally. This was an excellent chance to work with TS in ways that differ from my day to day.

- React was an easy reach for getting the repo up and running and giving me a workflow I am used to. The "logic" surrounding the fucntions could be finessed into whatever FE visualizer we could want.

## Thank you!

- For the chance to do this! I would love any feedback you could give
